  v0.50
    -> Misc changes:
        - Switched to relative paths for MAN pages. We let yelp figure
          where the page file is on the filesystem. This simplifies the
          code and closes down the problem with displaying pages from
          the (1posix) section

  v0.32
    -> Misc changes:
        - v0.31 code for cooperation with plain man did not work :(
          switched to alternative implementation
  v0.31
    -> New features:
          Now supports both man-db and plain man document systems
    -> Misc changes:
        - Replaced all `` command substitutions with new $() notation
        - Added $WINDOW_HEIGHT to control the size of the window (for
          now only used in multiple results list)

  v0.3
    -> New features:
        - Ask before doing a substring search
        - If a result is not found, loop back to initial dialog and
          ask for another page

  v0.2
    -> New features:
        - If no match is found, do a substring search
        - Skip the text entry dialog if a name is provided on the
          command line (ex. gman rsync)
    -> Fixed bugs:
        - In popup window with list of multiple hits, exit gracefully
          when pressing CANCEL, or OK without selecting an item first.
    -> Misc changes:
        - Added list of known bugs

  v0.1a
    - Initial release of G-Man
